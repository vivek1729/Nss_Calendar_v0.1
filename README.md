I am using the metroJs jquery plugin [www.drewgreenwell.com/projects/metrojs].
Currently it is possible to create events using the system already in place and the script fetches those events
from the tables and the refresh is not automatic though. We can scroll between months and see the details of
the events. This is to be integrated into a webite based on Drupla completely.
